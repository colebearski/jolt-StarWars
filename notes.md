Put any notes for us here.

Unfortunatley, I did not finish 100%. However, I plan on going back to do so. The commits should provide a good time table I figure.

The appreciate the time and opportunity with the assessment. This really brought React back to the forefront of what I have been wanting to work with. I really do enjoy this type of stack. I've been in more of a PHP MVC OOP world for the past little while but would love an opportunity to make the jump here.

Again, thank you for the time and consideration.
